== Current Status (v1.4.0, 100% ✓)

* **17 prover backends operational** (Coq, Lean, Isabelle, Agda, Z3, CVC5, ACL2, PVS, HOL4, Mizar, HOL Light, Metamath, Vampire, E Prover, SPASS, Alt-Ergo, Idris2)
* **3 API interfaces consolidated** into monorepo
  - GraphQL server (port 8080, async-graphql + axum)
  - gRPC server (port 50051, tonic + Protocol Buffers)
  - REST server (port 8000, axum + OpenAPI/Swagger)
* Julia ML layer supports all 17 provers with logistic regression
* Chapel parallel layer dispatches all 17 provers
* ReScript UI: 28 files compiled, 6 components functional
* Rust core: 17 prover backends, anomaly detection, aspect tagging
* Trust framework: benchmarks, PropTest, Idris2 validator, anomaly detection
* Training data: 332 proofs, 1,603 tactics across 12 provers
* 99 unit tests + 38 integration tests passing
* **License standardized**: PMPL-1.0-or-later throughout

== v1.4.0 Achievements (COMPLETE)

* [x] Added 5 new Tier 5 provers (Vampire, E Prover, SPASS, Alt-Ergo, Idris2)
* [x] Consolidated all interfaces into echidna monorepo under `src/interfaces/`
* [x] Updated all 3 layers (Rust, Julia, Chapel) to support 17 provers
* [x] Created GraphQL interface with type-safe schema
* [x] Created gRPC interface with bidirectional streaming
* [x] Created REST interface with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
* [x] Restored original name: "Cognitive Hybrid" (not "Computational Heuristic")
* [x] Full documentation update for v1.4.0

== Critical Gaps Identified

== v2.0 — Core Integration + Neural Upgrade (Next)

=== Core Integration Layer (HIGH PRIORITY)
Current interfaces cannot call Rust prover backends — no FFI/IPC layer exists.

* [ ] Implement FFI/IPC bridge for interfaces → Rust core
* [ ] Enable GraphQL/gRPC/REST to invoke real prover backends
* [ ] Production deployment configuration

=== Neural Upgrade
* [ ] Add Flux.jl to Julia Project.toml
* [ ] Train GNN encoder on proof graphs
* [ ] Train Transformer premise selector
* [ ] Expand training corpus to 600+ proofs
* [ ] Baseline performance benchmarks with Criterion.rs

=== Chapel Integration
* [ ] Chapel → Rust C FFI bridge
* [ ] Chapel neural-guided beam search (Julia HTTP integration)
* [ ] Multi-prover consensus voting via Chapel parallelism

=== Knowledge Integration
* [ ] OpenCyc domain knowledge integration
* [ ] Proof explanation in natural language
* [ ] End-to-end correctness certification pipeline

== v3.0 — Autonomous Proving

* [ ] Automated theorem discovery
* [ ] Cross-domain knowledge transfer
* [ ] Proof repair for failing proofs
* [ ] Mathlib/AFP/Coq stdlib integration
* [ ] Cloud deployment with GPU acceleration

== Julia/Chapel Layer Interaction

See CORRECTNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md section on "Compute Layer Integration"
for the recommended architecture unifying Julia ML, Chapel HPC, and Rust core.
