== Current Status (v1.3.0, 85%)

* 12 prover backends operational (Coq, Lean, Isabelle, Agda, Z3, CVC5, ACL2, PVS, HOL4, Mizar, HOL Light, Metamath)
* Julia ML: logistic regression serving predictions via HTTP
* ReScript UI: 28 files compiled, 6 components functional
* Rust core: 13 REST endpoints, anomaly detection, aspect tagging
* Trust framework: benchmarks, PropTest, Idris2 validator, anomaly detection
* Chapel PoC: parallel proof search validated (9/12 provers)
* 99 unit tests + 38 integration tests passing

== Critical Gaps

=== Chapel Integration (HIGH)
Chapel PoC is isolated — no FFI bridge to Rust or Julia.
Parallel proof search uses simulated provers, not real backends.

**Action**: Create Chapel -> Rust C FFI bridge. Enable Chapel to call
real prover backends and receive Julia neural guidance.

=== Julia ML Depth (HIGH)
Current ML is logistic regression (bag-of-words encoding).
GNN + Transformer architecture exists in code but is not trained.
Project.toml missing Flux.jl dependency.

**Action**: Add Flux.jl, train neural_solver.jl models on expanded corpus.

=== Correctness Certification (HIGH)
Trust framework exists but no end-to-end certification pipeline.
Users need machine-checkable proof certificates with provenance.

**Action**: See CORRECTNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md for full design.

== v1.4 — Neural Upgrade (Next)

* [ ] Add Flux.jl to Julia Project.toml
* [ ] Train GNN encoder on proof graphs
* [ ] Train Transformer premise selector
* [ ] Expand training corpus to 1000+ proofs
* [ ] Baseline performance benchmarks with Criterion.rs
* [ ] License update: PMPL-1.0-or-later throughout

== v2.0 — Chapel Integration + Correctness

* [ ] Chapel -> Rust C FFI bridge
* [ ] Chapel neural-guided beam search (Julia HTTP integration)
* [ ] End-to-end correctness certification pipeline
* [ ] Multi-prover consensus voting
* [ ] OpenCyc domain knowledge integration
* [ ] Proof explanation in natural language

== v3.0 — Autonomous Proving

* [ ] Automated theorem discovery
* [ ] Cross-domain knowledge transfer
* [ ] Proof repair for failing proofs
* [ ] Mathlib/AFP/Coq stdlib integration
* [ ] Cloud deployment with GPU acceleration

== Julia/Chapel Layer Interaction

See CORRECTNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md section on "Compute Layer Integration"
for the recommended architecture unifying Julia ML, Chapel HPC, and Rust core.
