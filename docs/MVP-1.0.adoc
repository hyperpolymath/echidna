:toc: macro
:toclevels: 2

This checklist defines the minimum shippable scope for ECHIDNA 1.0.

TOC::[]

== Scope

* All 12 core provers are wired and available via CLI + HTTP API.
* CLI supports prove/verify/search/interactive/server.
* HTTP API exposes health, provers, prove/verify/suggest/search, sessions.
* Basic smoke checks exist for prover executables and pipeline paths.
* Release documentation is updated and consistent.

== Prover Coverage (Core 12)

* Agda
* Coq
* Lean
* Isabelle
* Z3
* CVC5
* Metamath
* HOL Light
* Mizar
* PVS
* ACL2
* HOL4

== CLI

* `echidna prove` works for each prover (file-based proof).
* `echidna verify` works for each prover.
* `echidna search` works (at least for provers with theorem DBs).
* `echidna interactive` starts for each prover.
* `echidna server` starts API server and serves endpoints.

== HTTP API

* `GET /api/health` returns OK + version.
* `GET /api/provers` lists all 12 core provers.
* `POST /api/prove` accepts payload + returns success.
* `POST /api/verify` accepts payload + returns success.
* `POST /api/suggest` returns tactics (or explicit “not available”).
* `GET /api/search` returns matches (or explicit “not available”).
* `POST /api/session/create` creates a session.
* `GET /api/session/:id/state` returns state.
* `POST /api/session/:id/apply` applies tactic.

== Smoke Tests

* Script exists to check prover executables are available (or clearly report missing).
* Script runs minimal prove/verify for each prover when available.
* Dependency checklist is documented in `docs/MVP-1.0-DEPS.adoc`.
* Dependency checklist is documented in `docs/MVP-1.0-DEPS.adoc`.

== Missing Provers (Local)

This section tracks local gaps for the MVP drive. Update as tools are installed.
