# Debt register

Known, measured debt in this repository: licensing, documentation, and code.
Supersedes [`tech-debt-2026-05-26.md`](tech-debt-2026-05-26.md), which is
retained as a dated snapshot.

**Every entry carries the command that produced its figure.** An entry without
evidence is a rumour, and rumours do not belong in a debt register. Re-run the
commands from the repository root before acting on any item — they are the
definition of the finding, not a description of it.

Entries are **not** issues. Where a GitHub issue already tracks an item it is
linked; where the fix requires a decision only the owner can make, the entry
says so explicitly and stops there.

Priorities: **P0** — a downstream consumer can be actively misled or harmed.
**P1** — a reader is misinformed but not exposed. **P2** — friction, cost, or
latent risk.

## P0 — Licensing: RESOLVED 2026-08-07

**Was:** the repository stated four different licences at once — `LICENSE` and
`Cargo.toml` said AGPL-3.0-or-later while 590 source files granted MPL-2.0,
`NOTICE` described the project as MPL-2.0 while citing the AGPL file as its
text, and `.reuse/dep5` claimed `PMPL-1.0 AND Palimpsest-0.6`. Because
per-file SPDX headers are themselves a licence grant, a recipient could have
taken the tree under MPL-2.0 — which, unlike AGPL, has no network clause.

**Now:** reconciled to the owner's AGPL ruling as a deliberate three-part
split.

| Part | Licence | Files |
|---|---|---|
| Code — `src/`, `crates/`, `ffi/`, `proofs/`, `spark/`, `verification/`, build system, CI, machine-readable metadata | **AGPL-3.0-or-later** | 594 + 6 dual |
| Documentation — `docs/`, top-level `.md` / `.adoc` | **CC-BY-SA-4.0** | 92 + 1 dual |
| `echidna-playground/` — Coq-Jr sub-project | **MPL-2.0**, unchanged | 35 |

The playground was **not** relicensed: it carries contributions attributed to
"Coq-Jr Contributors", and relicensing another party's work needs their
consent. It does not need relicensing — MPL-2.0 §3.3 designates the GNU
licences (including AGPL-3.0+) as Secondary Licenses, so MPL files combine
into an AGPL work and the combined work distributes under AGPL while those
files individually remain available under MPL. No file carries the Exhibit B
"Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" notice that would break this.

`NOTICE` and `.reuse/dep5` were rewritten to describe the split; `LICENSE`
had two prepended SPDX lines removed so it is byte-identical to
`LICENSES/AGPL-3.0-or-later.txt` — those lines were stopping GitHub's licence
detector matching the body, which is why the repository showed "Other".

**Verification — these should come back clean:**

```bash
# no MPL outside the playground and licence reference material
git grep -l 'SPDX-License-Identifier:.*MPL-2\.0' \
  | grep -vE '^(echidna-playground/|LICENSES/|docs/legal/)'      # expect empty

# code is AGPL
git grep -I -h -m1 -oP 'SPDX-License-Identifier:\s*\K[A-Za-z0-9.\-+]+( (AND|OR) [A-Za-z0-9.\-+]+)*' \
  -- '*.rs' '*.jl' '*.zig' ':!echidna-playground/' | sort | uniq -c

# GitHub now detects a licence
gh repo view hyperpolymath/echidna --json licenseInfo
```

### Closed — `Palimpsest-0.6` grants removed

Seven files (later found to be 29) carried `Palimpsest-0.6` in their SPDX
identifier. The owner ruled these were never a deliberate legal grant:
`CONTRIBUTING.adoc` already recorded that the Palimpsest licence proper "is
the legal licence only on `palimpsest-license`, `palimpsest-plasma`, and
(prospectively) `consent-aware-http`", and that in ECHIDNA it is an *ethical
framework* reference, orthogonal to the SPDX choice. Version 0.6 is also
superseded by the `hyperpolymath/palimpsest-license` repository.

All Palimpsest SPDX identifiers were therefore removed. The framework
reference is preserved in `CONTRIBUTING.adoc` and `NOTICE`, which now state
explicitly that it is not a grant, so this cannot drift back in silently.

Two exclusions, deliberate: `training_data/proof_states_v2.jsonl` contains
SPDX strings as *scraped corpus content* (proof goals harvested from files,
recorded as data — editing them would corrupt the corpus), and `docs/legal/`
holds licence reference texts.

### Closed — three further licence-drift classes found by the deeper sweep

The SPDX-header sweep alone would have missed all of these. Recorded because
each is a distinct class worth re-checking after any future licence change:

1. **Stale `MIT` grants.** `src/rescript/.gitignore`, `styles/main.css` and
   `tailwind.config.js` still declared `MIT OR Palimpsest-0.6` — pre-dating
   even the MPL migration. Removing only the Palimpsest half would have left
   them **MIT**. Now AGPL-3.0-or-later.
2. **Machine-readable `license:` fields**, which are what packaging and
   tooling actually read, and which carry no `SPDX-License-Identifier:` line
   for a header sweep to match. Eight declared MPL-2.0:
   `docs-site/.well-known/aibdp.json` (served on the site), `stapeln.toml`,
   `container/manifest.toml`, three Ada `alire.toml` manifests under `spark/`,
   `.machine_readable/descriptiles/META.a2ml`, and `0-AI-MANIFEST.a2ml`.
   Plus a **nested `src/rescript/.reuse/dep5`** declaring `MIT OR
   Palimpsest-0.6` for the UI sub-tree.
3. **A user-facing licence string.** `src/rescript/src/Main.res` rendered
   `"MIT OR Palimpsest-0.6 License"` in the UI — a false licence statement
   shown to users, invisible to every header-based check.
4. **OCI image labels** — 16 `LABEL org.opencontainers.image.licenses="MPL-2.0"`
   across `Containerfile`, `container/Containerfile`, and the
   `.containerization/` tree (11 in `Containerfile.wave3` alone, one per
   per-prover stage). These are **baked into every image published to
   ghcr.io** and read by registries, SBOM generators and supply-chain
   scanners, so the wrong value propagates downstream of the repository
   entirely. Also `canonical-license` in
   `.machine_readable/anchors/ANCHOR.a2ml` and two Idris2 `.ipkg` manifests.

**Detector for next time** — a header sweep is not sufficient:

```bash
git grep -In '"license"' -- '*.json'
git grep -In '^license'   -- '*.toml' '*.a2ml'
git grep -In '^licenses'  -- '*.toml'
find . -name dep5 -not -path './.git/*'          # nested REUSE configs
git grep -InE '"(MIT|MPL|AGPL|Apache)[^"]*"' -- 'src/' 'site/'   # UI strings
git grep -In 'org.opencontainers.image.licenses'                 # OCI labels

# or, exhaustively — by value rather than by file type, which is what
# actually caught the last three classes:
git grep -InE '(license|licenses|licence)\s*[:=]\s*"?(MPL-2\.0|MIT|Palimpsest)' \
  | grep -v '^echidna-playground/'
```

## P1 — Documentation

### D1. Prover counts drift across surfaces *(issue [#251](https://github.com/hyperpolymath/echidna/issues/251))*

**Largely addressed** in the documentation refresh that added this file; recorded
because the underlying cause is structural and will recur.

The tree contained five different counts — 48, 105, 128, 138, 141 — because
four different things are all called "the number of provers": enum variants
(141), implementation files (105), implementations with `suggest_tactics`
(102), and default-exposed core backends (12). All four are defensible; none is
"the" count. [`PROVER_COUNT.md`](PROVER_COUNT.md) is now canonical, carries the
commands that reproduce each figure, and explains the denominators.

**Residual risk:** the `R5a` CI rule
(`.github/canonical-references/prover-counts.yml`) that forbids bare counts
covers only the top-level document set named in that file. `docs/`,
`.machine_readable/`, `crates/*/README.md` and `.github/*.md` are **out of
scope**, which is precisely where the drift accumulated. Extending the rule's
scope is unfinished work.

### D2. Tier membership is hand-maintained and unverifiable

`PROVER_COUNT.md`'s tier table is the routing contract, but only Tier 1
(`ProverKind::all_core()`) and Tier 9 are machine-checkable. Tier 4's
"19 placeholder backends" and Tier 8's "13 corpus-only provers" are asserted,
not derived, and were not re-measured in this pass — they are marked as
indicative in the table. Making tier membership an attribute on each
`ProverKind` variant would make the table generated rather than maintained.

### D3. Unearned OpenSSF Best Practices badge

`README.md` displays a hardcoded green "OpenSSF Best Practices" badge that
links to the project **registration** form, not to a passing scorecard:

```bash
grep -oE 'bestpractices.dev[^)]*' README.md
# bestpractices.dev/en/projects/new?repo_url=https://github.com/hyperpolymath/echidna
```

The badge image is a static `img.shields.io` green label, so it will read as
"passed" regardless of the project's actual standing — including now, when the
project is not registered. Either register the project and use the real badge
(which reflects the true tier and changes when it lapses), or remove the badge.
A permanently-green badge that cannot fail is indistinguishable from a false
claim. This is a known estate-wide pattern, not unique to this repository.

### D4. Broken links in historical release notes

Nine dead links remain in `docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.2.md` and
`RELEASE_NOTES_v1.3.md`, pointing at design documents that are not in the tree
(`CHAPEL_METALAYER_ANALYSIS.md`, `ZIG_FFI_ANALYSIS.md`,
`FUTURE_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, and others). Live documents
were repaired in the refresh; these were deliberately left, because release
notes are dated records and rewriting them rewrites history. They should either
be de-linked in place or the referenced documents restored from git history.

```bash
# re-measure broken relative links across all Markdown/AsciiDoc
git grep -nE '\]\([A-Za-z0-9_./-]+\.(md|adoc)\)' -- '*.md' '*.adoc' | while IFS= read -r l; do
  src="${l%%:*}"; ref=$(echo "$l" | grep -oE '\]\([A-Za-z0-9_./-]+\)' | sed -E 's/^\]\(//;s/\)$//')
  for r in $ref; do [ -e "$(dirname "$src")/$r" ] || echo "$src -> $r"; done
done
```

### D5. `echidna-playground/SECURITY.md` references absent files

It links to `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and
`SECURITY-ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md` inside `echidna-playground/`; none exist
(`ls echidna-playground/`). The sub-project's security policy therefore
directs a reporter to nothing. Either add the files or point the links at the
parent repository's equivalents.

### D6. Root scaffold documents displaced the real ones — *fixed, recorded*

`ARCHITECTURE.md` and `GOVERNANCE.md` at the repository root contained generic
template text with **zero** project-specific content, while the real documents
sat at `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (160 lines) and `GOVERNANCE.adoc` (162 lines):

```bash
grep -icE 'echidna|prover|neurosym|trust' ARCHITECTURE.md     # was 0
grep -icE 'echidna|prover|RSR|hyperpolymath' GOVERNANCE.md     # was 0
```

This was worse than duplication. GitHub surfaces the `.md` member in its
community-standards checks and contributor prompts, so the document most
readers landed on described a project that could have been anything. Both are
now explicit pointers to the canonical documents, following the pattern
`CONTRIBUTING.md` already used correctly.

**Watch for recurrence:** these files match the estate's scaffold-template
shape, so a future template sweep may reinstate them. The check above is the
detector — a root `.md` scoring 0 is scaffold, not documentation.

### D7. `.machine_readable/6a2/` no longer exists

The six descriptiles moved to `.machine_readable/descriptiles/`. Seventeen
documents pointed at the old path and were repaired in the refresh, but the
contractile configurations still name `.machine_readable/6a2/DRIFT.a2ml` and
`.machine_readable/6a2/ratification-<session-id>.a2ml` as **write
destinations**:

```bash
git grep -n '6a2/' -- '*.ncl'
```

Those were left alone deliberately: `6a2` is a concept name there, not a stale
path, and changing a contractile's evidence sink is a semantic decision. But the
directory does not exist, so any drift-log write has nowhere to land. Confirm
whether the sink should be created or repointed.

## P2 — Code

### C1. ReScript — removed 2026-08

The 37 ReScript files (24 in `src/rescript/`, 13 orphaned `.res` prover
clients in `src/provers/`) were deleted, along with the build and CI wiring
that referenced them. ReScript is a banned language under the estate policy.

**The replacement is not ready, and that is now visible rather than hidden.**
The AffineScript-TEA sources sit at `src/ui/tea/` but the compile pipeline is
unwired, blocked on missing primitives — `Http::fetch`, `Async`, `Json` —
tracked in [#266](https://github.com/hyperpolymath/echidna/issues/266) and
[#117](https://github.com/hyperpolymath/echidna/issues/117). `just build-ui`
now **fails with an explanatory message** instead of silently doing nothing;
`serve-ui` serves the static shell at `src/ui/public/`.

`echidna-playground/` keeps its 8 `.res` files: that sub-project carries
Coq-Jr contributions, so removing them is a separate decision from a
language-policy cleanup.

### C1b. `.gitlab-ci.yml` is not valid YAML

`python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.gitlab-ci.yml'))"` fails on a
bare `%` inside an unquoted shell command. **Pre-existing** — verified by
parsing the file at `HEAD` before the ReScript removal shifted the line
number. Whether it matters depends on whether the GitLab mirror actually runs
CI; if it does not, the file is decorative and should say so or go.

### C2. 185 `#[allow(dead_code)]` suppressions

```bash
git grep -c 'allow(dead_code)' -- '*.rs' | awk -F: '{s+=$2} END{print s}'
```

Each one silences the compiler's own report of unreachable code. At this volume
the suppressions, not the compiler, define what counts as live code — so genuine
dead code is no longer detectable. Worth a pass to distinguish
scaffolding-for-planned-work (annotate with the tracking issue) from code that
should be deleted.

### C3. Placeholder backends are indistinguishable from working ones at the API

Tier 4 backends are `ProverKind` variants with mock-only invocation, but they
are reachable through the same `ProverKind` selection as real ones. A caller
selecting one receives a response shaped like a proof result. `container-ci.yml`
runs stub-sentinel detection for Tier-3 cells; the corresponding guarantee for
Tier-4 placeholders at the API boundary is not documented. Related: D2 — the
placeholder count itself is unverified.

### C4. `Dogfood Gate` fails K9 validation on `main`

Observed 2026-08-07 on every PR run:

```
Hunt-level K9 file must include a 'signature' or 'signature_required' field
K9 validation failed with 1 error(s)
```

A contractile/K9 schema requirement that the repository's own hunt-level K9
file does not satisfy — the dogfooding gate cannot pass its own rules. Not
diagnosed further here; reproduce with
`gh run list -R hyperpolymath/echidna --workflow "Dogfood Gate"` and read the
failing step.

### C5. `Rust CI` test failures on `main`

`cargo test --tests --workspace --locked` exits 101 under `llvm-cov`. This is a
genuine test failure, not infrastructure: it appears **after** the toolchain
installs and the workspace builds. Distinguish it from the lockfile-pin
startup failures that affected the same workflow until the
`dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` relock — those failed *before* running a step
and produced no test output. Individual failing tests have not been
enumerated; that is the next action.

`Secret Scanner` also exits 1 on `main`; likely the dead `VERISIMDB_PAT`
already tracked in [#310](https://github.com/hyperpolymath/echidna/issues/310),
but not confirmed here.

### C6. Unfinished-work markers

Low and healthy for a tree this size — recorded as a baseline to watch:

```bash
git grep -cE 'TODO|FIXME|XXX' -- '*.rs' | awk -F: '{s+=$2} END{print s}'   # 11 across 6 files
git grep -cE 'todo!\(\)|unimplemented!\(\)' -- '*.rs' | awk -F: '{s+=$2} END{print s}'   # 1
```
