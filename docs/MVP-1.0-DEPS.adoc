== Quick Check

Run:

----
just mvp
----

Missing executables are reported explicitly. This is expected on dev machines.

== Optional Helpers

* `just mvp-env` (best-effort checklist) prints what is missing.
* Prefer installing provers locally for full MVP validation.

== Local Snapshot (Fedora 43) - 2026-01-19

This is a local environment note for the current MVP drive (host + toolbox).
It is *not* a general availability statement for all platforms.

* Present: `lean`, `z3`, `mizar`, `pvs`
* Missing: `agda`, `coqtop`, `cvc5`, `metamath`, `acl2`, `hol4`, `hol-light`, `isabelle`
* Notes:
** `mizar` verifies successfully inside toolbox; host `verifier` previously failed with sandbox restrictions.
** `guix` is not available via `dnf` inside toolbox; manual install required if we choose the Guix route.
